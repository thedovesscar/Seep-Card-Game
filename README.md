# Seep - A Punjabi Card Game
Decided to create a Single Player version of the Punjabi Classic Card game Seep, since I don't think anyone else in the world has yet!
Not that I really tried that hard to look.

There were exactly 2 multiplayer versions of Seep on the Apple App Store, they were enjoyable but I still feel like I'll have something unique to offer.
